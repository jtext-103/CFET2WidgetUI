# Introduction of Status

## What is Status in CFET ?

CFET is designed to be a control systom based on the concept of 'Thing'. ``CFET abstractly encapsulates all objects to be controlled into things.`` And Status is a property of Things that cannot be changed and can only be read. It represent the current states of a thing that the thing wants others to know.

***For instance**, if the air conditioner is the object you want to control, so the air conditioner is the thing in CFET, and the status is the current state of the air conditioner, such as on or off.*
